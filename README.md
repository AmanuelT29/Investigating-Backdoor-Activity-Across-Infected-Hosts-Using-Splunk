# Investigating-Backdoor-Activity-Infected-Hosts-Using-Splunk

## Scenario Details
SOC Analyst has observed some anomalous behaviours in the logs of a few windows machines. It looks like the adversary has access to some of these machines and successfully created some backdoor. My task as SOC Analyst is to examine the logs and identify the anomalies. All relevant logs are the index "main".

## Objective
In this investigation, I aim to identify and confirm potential indicators of compromise across suspected infected hosts. To do this, I will raise and methodically answer a series of key questions that guide each step of the process. This approach will help uncover any malicious activity, such as unauthorized account creation, suspicious command executions, or registry changes. The goal is to demonstrate how a structured analysis using tools like Splunk can be used to detect and respond to backdoor activity within a compromised environment.
